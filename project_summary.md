## Description

MRSA - Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus a bacteria almost all of us carry on our skin.  Since the 1940s the bacterium mutated as it became accustomed to antibiotic drugs.  Hospitals have become the battle ground between infection and our ability to control it seems to be tipping out of our favour.  

The piece connects the organic growth, replication and mutation with its geography.

I use a simple biological simulation to represent the mutating bacteria.  The simulation is processor intensive - but lends itself to computation on the GPU.  WebGL technology is used to run the simulation at speed.  

As MRSA data is posted, this will be harvested and guide the animations live.
