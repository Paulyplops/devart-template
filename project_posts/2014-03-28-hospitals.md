The maps are seeded from the set of hospitals reporting a MRSA related death within the last week.  The work is intended to be presented as a projection onto the floor, encouraging the viewer to examine the growth and changes in detail.

The data is aggregated weekly at [data.gov.uk](http://data.gov.uk/dataset/nhs-meticillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-bacteraemia-dataset-weekly/resource/95e77d31-e9ed-4762-8f28-02a878f1a391 "MRSA Data").  This will be updated so the sites selected change as the exhibition progresses.
