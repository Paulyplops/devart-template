When using the streets to seed the simulation, we get interesting behaviour for a short time during the growth, but as the environment is overrun the large scale structure is consumed.

To get the map to play a more central role, I am using it as the food over which the bacteria grows.  This needs to be added initially, and as the simulation unfolds.  The system behaves differently when the concentration of food changes.

- In areas where food is plentiful, the growth is fast and coral-like.  Lines emerge as the reaction spreads, branching in space as it is found.
- Where food is scarce the reaction is slow.  Here we see mitosis, where an isolated portion of the reaction reproduces, splitting in a cellular fashion.

A number of technical hurdles needed to be addressed.  To deliver the food to the algorithm shader-program we now need to deal with two textures.

- A working texture with the current state of the reaction.
- The food texture which indicates which cells get fed and how much.

The roads supplied on the map are too thin to encourage anything more complex than linear growth.  Before being loaded into the food and initial texture, we dilate the map image using an off-screen HTML5 canvas.  This image processing technique thickens the streets used to stimulate the reaction.  Care needs to be taken with performance as larger kernels can be very slow to apply. 

As the map will change from run to run, we must be sure to seed the animation on a road.  If it falls outside a fed area, the bacteria will die off before it gets a chance to grow.

The parameters of the simulation are animated as it unfolds, to increase the decay (kill rate) over time.  The type of growth changes, and eventually areas that are highly populated begin to die off.
