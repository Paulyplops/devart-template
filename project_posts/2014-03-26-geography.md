To connect this rather abstract animation to the environment that MRSA thrives, I have decided to use maps as the canvas.

The following simulation uses a map rendered live from google static map API to seed the organism.  This provides some large scale, twig-like structure, that appears to bud and bloom as the process unfolds.
