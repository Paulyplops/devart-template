First attempt at running a reaction-diffusion simulation.  

[Wikipedia - Reaction Diffusion System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction%E2%80%93diffusion_system/ "Reaction Diffusion System")

The green areas are the active organism.  Red areas represent the food that the reaction consumes.

When setting up the simulation a balance must be struck.  If there is not enough food, the bacteria cannot grow.  If there is too much bacteria together, then it consumes the food too fast, leading to extinction.  When the supply of food is balanced with growth and death, complexity begins to arise.

The system can be watched evolving inside the browser.
