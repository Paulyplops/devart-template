To connect this rather abstract animation to the environment in which MRSA thrives, I have decided to use maps as the canvas.

The following simulation uses a map rendered live from Google [Static Map API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/staticmaps/ "Static Maps API") to seed the organism.  This provides some large scale, twig-like structure, that appears to bud and bloom as the process unfolds.

By using the streets to seed the simulation, we are drawing a map of bacteria into the petri-dish.
